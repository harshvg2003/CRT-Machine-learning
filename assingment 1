1.Difference Between Lists and Tuples
Mutability & Performance:

Lists: Mutable (can be modified after creation), slower performance due to dynamic allocation.
Tuples: Immutable (cannot be modified after creation), faster as they use less memory.
Use lists when you need a dynamic collection that can change.
Use tuples when you need a fixed, unchangeable sequence for efficiency.

2. Type Conversion in Python:
Python supports implicit and explicit type conversion:
Implicit Conversion (Automatic by Python):
x = 10   # Integer
y = 2.5  # Float
z = x + y  # Python automatically converts x to float
print(z, type(z))  # Output: 12.5 <class 'float'>

Explicit Conversion (Using functions like int(), float(), str(), list()):
num_str = "100"
num_int = int(num_str)  # Converts string to integer
print(num_int, type(num_int))  # Output: 100 <class 'int'>

3. Using += Operator
num = 5
num += 10  # Increases num by 10
print(num)  # Output: 15

4. Leap Year Check
year = int(input("Enter a year: "))
if (year % 4 == 0 and year % 100 != 0) or (year % 400 == 0):
    print(f"{year} is a leap year.")
else:
    print(f"{year} is not a leap year.")
   
5. Grading System
marks = int(input("Enter your marks: "))

if 90 <= marks <= 100:
    grade = "A"
elif 80 <= marks < 90:
    grade = "B"
elif 70 <= marks < 80:
    grade = "C"
elif 60 <= marks < 70:
    grade = "D"
else:
    grade = "F"

print(f"Your grade is: {grade}")
